# **Loan-Prediction**

A project which uses machine learning to check if the person is more likely to recieve the Loan that he/she receives, We trained our model on variety of dataset showing different kind of people with various status and likeness to return the Loan and our model understood the pattern of the Data on which we have used it to build a simple webapp with flask to show the process

### In this task , we created a model that can predict wheather a person will receive Loan from Bank or not on the basis of some selected features. We then normalize the data and train it to our Machine Learning Model and achived 82.93 % accuracy by applying Bayes Theorem algorithm to it.
